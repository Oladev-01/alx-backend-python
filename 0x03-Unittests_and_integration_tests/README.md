# 0x03-Unittests and Integration Tests

## Overview

This project focuses on unit testing and integration testing in Python. You'll learn how to write robust and thorough tests for your Python code, ensuring the correctness and reliability of your applications. The project explores various testing techniques, including how to write unit tests for different parts of your code and how to integrate testing with mock objects to simulate external systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the purpose and benefits of unit and integration tests.
- Write unit tests to validate small parts of your code independently.
- Use the `unittest` module in Python to create and organize your test cases.
- Employ `mock` objects to simulate dependencies in your tests.
- Test functions that depend on external systems (e.g., APIs, databases).
- Understand the differences between unit tests and integration tests.
- Use assertions such as `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertRaises`, and `assertAlmostEqual` to verify the expected output.
- Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) to build more reliable code.

### Files and Directories
- **models/**: Contains the business logic that you'll write unit tests for.
- **tests/**: Includes the unit and integration test cases.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies required for the project (e.g., Python packages).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your local machine, along with some key libraries:
- Python 3.x
- `unittest` (built-in with Python)
- `mock` (use `unittest.mock` in Python 3.x)

To install additional dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Tests

To run the tests for your project, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

This command will automatically discover and execute all the test cases under the `tests/` directory.

## Key Concepts

### Unit Testing

Unit testing focuses on testing individual components (functions, classes) of your code in isolation. The goal is to verify that each component behaves as expected, independent of others. In this project, you will write unit tests for specific functions, methods, and classes in the `models` module.

Example of a basic unit test:

```python
import unittest
from models.data_processor import DataProcessor

class TestDataProcessor(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_process_data(self):
        processor = DataProcessor()
        result = processor.process_data([1, 2, 3])
        self.assertEqual(result, [2, 3, 4])
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests check how different components work together as a whole. Youâ€™ll test how your modules interact with external systems, such as databases, APIs, or other services.

Example of an integration test with a mock object:

```python
from unittest import TestCase, mock
from models.data_processor import DataProcessor

class TestDataProcessorIntegration(TestCase):
    @mock.patch('models.data_processor.requests.get')
    def test_api_integration(self, mock_get):
        mock_get.return_value.json.return_value = {'status': 'success'}
        processor = DataProcessor()
        response = processor.fetch_data_from_api('https://example.com/api')
        self.assertEqual(response['status'], 'success')
```

### Common Assertions

Here are some commonly used assertions in `unittest`:
- **`assertEqual(a, b)`**: Check if `a == b`.
- **`assertTrue(expr)`**: Verify that `expr` is `True`.
- **`assertFalse(expr)`**: Verify that `expr` is `False`.
- **`assertRaises(exception)`**: Ensure a specific exception is raised.
- **`assertAlmostEqual(a, b)`**: Verify that `a` and `b` are approximately equal (for floating-point comparisons).

## Example Workflow

1. **Write your code**: Implement the logic in the `models` module.
2. **Write unit tests**: Create test cases for the functions and classes you wrote.
3. **Run tests**: Execute the tests using `unittest` to ensure everything is working as expected.
4. **Mock external dependencies**: Use `unittest.mock` to simulate API calls or database access in your integration tests.
5. **Fix any failing tests**: Refactor the code or tests until they pass.
