## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use type annotations in Python.
- Annotate variables, functions, and classes with type hints.
- Apply type hints to improve code readability and help with debugging.
- Leverage type checking tools like `mypy` to validate your code.


## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.
- **mypy**: A static type checker for Python. Install it via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install mypy
  ```


## Usage

To run the code for a specific task:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 0x00-python_variable_annotations
   ```

2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python3 task_0.py
   ```

3. (Optional) Run `mypy` to check for type errors:
   ```bash
   mypy task_0.py
   ```
