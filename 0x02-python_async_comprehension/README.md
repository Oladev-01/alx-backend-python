# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Description

This project introduces the concepts of asynchronous programming in Python, focusing on the use of asynchronous comprehensions. You will learn how to write asynchronous generator functions, use `async` and `await` keywords, and how to efficiently handle asynchronous operations using comprehensions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of asynchronous programming in Python.
- Write and execute asynchronous generator functions.
- Use `async` and `await` to manage asynchronous tasks.
- Implement asynchronous comprehensions to process data more efficiently.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Familiarity with Python coroutines, generators, and basic async/await syntax.


## Usage

To test any of the tasks, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
$ python3 -m asyncio 0-async_generator.py
$ python3 -m asyncio 1-async_comprehension.py
$ python3 -m asyncio 2-measure_runtime.py
